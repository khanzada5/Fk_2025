    <h1>First <span> generation</span> Of Suzuki Hayabusa</h1>
    <p>The Suzuki GSX1300R Hayabusa is a sports motorcycle made by Suzuki since 1999. It immediately won acclaim as the world's fastest production motorcycle, with a top speed of 303 to 312 km/h (188 to 194 mph).In 1999, fears of a European regulatory backlash or import ban[6][7][8][9] led to an informal agreement between the Japanese and European manufacturers to govern the top speed of their motorcycles at an arbitrary limit starting in late 2000.[10]</p>

    <h1>Top <span>speed</span> limited by agreement</h1>
    <p>With rumors and then pre-release announcements of much greater power in Kawasaki's Ninja ZX-12R in 2000, clearly attempting to unseat Suzuki and regain lucrative bragging rights, the speed war appeared to be escalating. There were growing fears of carnage and mayhem from motorcycles getting outrageously faster every year, and there was talk of regulating hyper sport motorcycles, or banning their import to Europe.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Other <span>developments</span></h1>
    <p>After the inclusion of the speed limiting system in 2001,[2][3] the Hayabusa remained substantially the same through the 2007 model year. An exception was a response to the problem of the aluminum rear subframe on 1999 and 2000 models breaking when the bike may have been overloaded with a passenger and luggage, and/or stressed by an aftermarket exhaust modification, so 2001 and later Hayabusas had a steel</p>

    <h1>Competitive <span>motorsports</span></h1>
    <p>Many riders have found that the Hayabusa lends itself well to any number of functional purposes, including competitive motorsports.The Hayabusa has been used in sanctioned closed course road racing,[59][60] drag racing,[61] and top speed competition.[62]</p>

    <h1>Power <span>enhancement</span></h1>
    <p>Further information on turbochargers, superchargers and nitrous oxide: Forced induction in motorcycles
     Horsepower enhancements like nitrous injection, which can add 100 bhp (75 kW), and turbocharging, which can raise power to more than 600 bhp (450 kW),[73] are common.</p>

     <h1>Police <span>use</span></h1>
     <p>n 2006 the Oklahoma Highway Patrol (OHP) converted a seized Hayabusa into a pursuit vehicle, setting up the bike with equipment including a radar unit, police lights, and siren, and painting it in official colors and insignia. Impressed with the positive response from the public and the motorcycling community, the OHP purchased two more Hayabusas, to supplement</p>

     <h1>Other uses of the <span>Hayabusa</span> engine</h1>
     <p>The high-powered lightweight engine in the Hayabusa lends itself to non-motorcycle applications. The Westfield Megabusa is an English sports car, based on the Lotus Seven, which uses the Hayabusa engine.[78] Suzuki was the first to put the motorcycle's engine in a car, with two concept cars in 2001, the Suzuki GSX-R/4 roadster and the Formula Hayabusa, an open wheel race car "designed for a new Japanese</p>
