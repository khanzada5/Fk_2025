    <center><h1>Banana</h1>
        <p>A banana is an elongated, edible fruit, botanically a berry, produced by large, treelike herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. Bananas are a good source of potassium, magnesium, vitamin B6, and other important nutrients. They're good for digestive and heart health. You can eat this tropical fruit raw, or add it to smoothies or baked goods.</p>
